# Produni

A work-in-progress website built using NextJS and Tailwind CSS. The goal is to design a study dashboard for students to add their timetables, exams, homework and study plans. Additionally I plan on adding a pomodoro timer as well as an algorithm to suggest tasks for a single day based on the user's priorities.

# Current strategies used

* NextJS with NextAuth authentication
* JWT OAuth Tokens
* Refresh token rotation
* Tailwind CSS for design

# Future plans
* Connect React to MongoDB database
* Use Redux for state management
* Print functionality to print timetable & tasks
* Deployment to Vercel with a postbuild script
